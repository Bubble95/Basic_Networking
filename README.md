# Basic_Networking
Project to learn basic python by simple socket and GUI programming

This project is not finished yet. I am open to any type of remarks and extensions.
For now, it is possible to use the classes Client and Server in order to transfer a file from the server to the client. The module is called networking.py and its application is shown in filereception.py and filetransfer.py.
